								<p style="font-size: 50%">
									At the outset of the study we decided on a
									definition of ‘television’ and we took our inspiration from an Oxford Dictionaries
									entry that is as relevant today as it was 90 years ago:<br>
									television, noun - a system for converting visual images (with sound)
									into electrical signals, signals, transmitting them by radio or
									other means, and displaying them electronically on a screen.<br>
									In other words television is not an object (unlike the TV set),
									television is a creative medium that can be transmitted and dis-
									played in a variety of forms, as such we informed our respondents
									that they should consider television to be all long form
									broadcast quality video irrespective of how or where consumed.

							Why has television been so resilient in the face
							of this unprecedented shift in the media
							landscape, where others have floundered?
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							Above all it comes down to the deeply emotional and
							human experience of television. It uniquely has the power
							to move us and in doing so creates powerful bonds.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							86% of us say television prompts sentiment – making us cry, dream or
							think; 71% say that television makes them excited, upset or truly
							elated; 60% claim that television helps them to escape their worries
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							“I became hooked on the show ‘Six Feet Under’. The series finale
							ended...and I was in tears for about 30 minutes after...the way it was
							made, made me think of the concept of death in a whole new way”
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							And it’s not just an emotional relationship that we have
							with television it’s also an intellectual one. Television acts
							as educator, influence and trusted advisor
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							78% say television helps them learn about the world around them and
							70% say television shapes and influences their opinion
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							“(Television provides) unexpected questions, situations, perspectives
							and thoughts that can come about as it makes you think differently
							and expands your horizons”
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							Television made the world a smaller place long before the
							internet and continues to be the pre-eminent place to get our
							trusted information from. The advent of ‘multi-screening’ has
							facilitated the curiosity to learn more ignited by television
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							67% will use a second screen whilst watching the TV set, 47% stating
							that they enjoy the freedom to discover more about what they’re
							watching
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							“When my boyfriend was watching ‘Narcos’, and I thought I might get
							into that show...I Googled about the character that it’s about...and
							found the story really interesting”
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							And it is the strength of the emotional and intellectual
							connection that makes us want to share our television thoughts
							and experiences with others
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							during or after television shows 64% of us talk or message friends and
							family, 52% of us go online to discover more and 42% share, tweet or
							blog online

						<p>
							“Talking with friends about a TV Show? OMG - Daily at work!! During

					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							The emotional bond between television and audiences
							translates into a powerful advertising environment that
							similarly can’t be replicated by other media
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							82% of respondents felt that television advertising evoked an emotion
							print/radio/OOH (x1.7) – which translated to 60% stating that
							television advertising provoked a call to action, compared to just 24%
							compared to 47% for ads on websites (x1.7) and 46% ads in
							for websites.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							“Online advertising is almost always done badly. Popups, video ads, etc
							make me annoyed, and I have built up a big filter. Youtube ads I just
							click away without ever noticing, if a webpage has popup ads I close
							the browser and never visit the site again”
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							One of the fastest growing media is short-form online video with
							the likes of Youtube and Facebook claiming billions of views a
							day. It is also one of the fastest growing advertising media, so we
							asked our respondents a number of questions about how
							viewing an ad in long form television compared to short form.
							The first thing they said is that they don’t notice online video
							advertising
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							63% of respondents claimed to pay attention to advertising
							during/around live television compared to 39% for online video
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							“I just wait for ‘Skip now’. When I’m going to YouTube I want to watch
							something straight away. I know it’s got to be there or it’s not going to
							make them money, but as soon as ‘Skip now’ comes on, that’s it”
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
					  <p>
							Short form video is transient in nature and far less emotionally
							engaging than long form television and this transposes on the
							way advertising is consumed even when it’s the same ad. We
							asked respondents “if you were to see the same ad in two
							different places: once as part of a commercial break during a TV
							show, and once before watching a short video clip online. Would
							you feel differently about the ad, based on the context in which
							you saw it?” and the results were overwhelming:
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							41% felt that the ad would be trustworthy in television compared to 14% in short form,
							and 44% felt that the advertising would be engaging compared to 16% in short form.
							Conversely 38% felt that an ad around short form video is distracting and annoying
							compared to just 17% for television.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							“having to sit through a 30sec advert to watch a short video clip is not
							acceptable, so I close the video”
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							The emotional bond does not exist for short form video, and its
							transient nature makes this an environment where permission
							to enter is more limited. In contrast television sells a unique
							currency, one which delivers a quality of attention and
							identification with plots, characters and real life stories that
							people want to know about or be part of
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							66% of respondents agreed that “television sells unique experiences and cultural currency
							that extends well beyond the live broadcast” with 69% saying television ignited
							conversations and therefore 50% agreeing that television advertising can ignite
							conversations.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							“TV is an integral part of my life, it's where my family gathers and it
							helps start conversations”
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							Television truly encapsulates the human
							experience – this is why television is about
							more than just traffic, views or clicks. The
							emotive allure of television relates to all of us
							in different ways.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-menu-title="Beyond Demographics">
						<h1>BEYOND...DEMOGRAPHICS</h1>
						<p>
							Television relates to us all in different ways,
							and our relationship is dictated by a number of
							behavioural and emotional relationships. The
							way we consume and use television cannot be
							summarised by how old we are or whether we
							or male and female. We reject the notion that
							18-24 year olds consume television one way
							and over 50’s another, the landscape is far
							more nuanced.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							Therefore we created a number of statistically robust
							personas to give a perspective on how television is really
							consumed in 2016
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Companions (22%) Television has always been an important part of their life; it entertains them,
							expands their knowledge, and is the best way for them to check-in on world events. They prefer to
							watch on a TV set and usually live programmes. For them television is a constant reliable
							companion and if they’ve watched something impactful it can stay with them for a long time, it can
							also give them something to talk (or laugh) about with their friends.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Balancers (10%) Television has to fit around them and their busy life, and they really rely on
							catch-up and on-demand services. Television is their personal haven, it helps them to escape and
							unwind away from their busy and sometimes stressful week. Watching television can be with their
							family, but often it is golden ‘me-time’ for them when they can watch what they want.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							Therefore we created a number of statistically robust
							personas to give a perspective on how television is really
							consumed in 2016
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Lovers (19%) Television is everywhere – it is the first thing they put on when they wake up and the
							last thing to help them switch off at night, and new technology has given them more television
							than ever. They love talking to their friends about television either on Facebook or at work the
							next day. Television is their playground – it is best when it brings all the family together, tucking
							into the latest must-watch or indulging in a boxset or a movie. It’s not uncommon to see them
							reaching for a tissue, sitting on the edge of their seat, or shouting at the screen.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Projectors (6%) Television is digitally enabled – it is programmes that can be found anywhere and
							everywhere and on any of their devices. They try to keep on top of new shows and are generally
							the first of their friends to start watching new series. As well as watching live, they watch a lot of
							programs on-demand or through streaming services like Netflix. They like to have their
							smartphone to-hand so they can look up something about a character or a storyline, Tweet or post
							on Facebook.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							Therefore we created a number of statistically robust
							personas to give a perspective on how television is really
							consumed in 2016
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Selectives (21%) Television is part of their toolkit – it sits alongside many other forms of media
							such as newspapers, magazines and the internet as something they’ll pick up as and when they
							need it. They would say they’re quite discerning in what they choose to watch, and they don’t just
							put on any old rubbish. They often explore online after they’ve watched something to find out
							more, television can be an open window to the world, an opportunity to learn.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Sceptics (22%) Television is an acquaintance – it doesn’t play a huge role in their life. They
							wouldn’t want to pay extra for channels they won’t really watch and tend to just stick to
							free-to-air, live television when they are watching. They don’t know if they’ll need a television in
							their house in the future or whether it will have a prominent place – they just don’t watch it
							enough. Sceptics say television is a time killer alongside the internet – they don’t get hugely
							emotional about these types of media.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							Across the personas the average age is similar (slightly younger
							for Projectors), the main differentials are in their relationship
							with technology and their attitude towards television. When
							looking at television advertising through these personas we get
							some fascinating results, taking the 30second ad in long form vs.
							short form environments
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Long form television x times more powerful than short form at being
							trustworthy – Companions x5.6; Balancers x2.0; Lovers x8.8,
							Projectors x1.2; Selectives x2.7; Sceptics x1.6
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							Everyone has a connection with television in some form or
							another, how that connection differs is down to your
							emotional and intellectual need states, and not how old you
							are.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section data-menu-title="Beyond 2016">
					<h2>BEYOND...2016</h2>
					<p>
						Television in 2016 and beyond is like television
						used to be, but more so. More choice, more
						access, more flexibility and more power to
						engage, inspire, excite & delight like no other
						media.
						In an ever evolving media landscape the
						position of television as #1 for advertising
