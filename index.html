						<h1>TELEVISION:<br> BEYOND TV</h1>
						<p style="font-size: 50%">
							At the outset of the study we decided on a
							definition of ‘television’ and we took our inspiration from an Oxford Dictionaries
							entry that is as relevant today as it was 90 years ago:<br>
							television, noun - a system for converting visual images (with sound)
							into electrical signals, signals, transmitting them by radio or
							other means, and displaying them electronically on a screen.<br>
							In other words television is not an object (unlike the TV set),
							television is a creative medium that can be transmitted and dis-
							played in a variety of forms, as such we informed our respondents
							that they should consider television to be all long form
							broadcast quality video irrespective of how or where consumed.
						</p>

						<h1>BEYOND THE BOX</h1>
						<p>
							If some had predicted that the arrival of digital
							and all its forms of entertainment and
							distractions would overwhelm television, then
							in fact the opposite happened...<br><br>
							Digital has come along and liberated television
							from the box that it was previously held in.
					  </p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							The digital revolution has made television content
							available anytime, anywhere and in doing so pushed it
							firmly into the digital melting pot.
						</p>
						<p>
							71% of television is now consumed on the TV set; almost a third of
							viewing is taking place on laptops, tablets and smartphones.[more data]
						</p>
						<p>
							“I watch some television via online media players on my tablet and
							smartphone, but my main television viewing is on my new large 50
							inch TV”
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>And we can see this trend is even more marked
							 with the younger generation:</p>
						<br>
						<p>53% of 16-34 yr. olds television viewing takes place on a TV set</p>
						<br>
						<p>“I use the screen that is appropriate for the moment”</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							However, it is not the case that the younger generation are
							watching less television:
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							16-34 yr. old television viewers are watching on average 3.9
							hours a day compared to 3.9 hours for 35-44 yr. olds and 4.4
							hours for 55-65 yr. olds
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							When we asked viewers what they thought about the ‘new
							television’ vs. the ‘old television’, mostly they were confused as to
							why we were making a distinction, for them there was no
							difference in content, just more flexibility in consumption
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							regularly claim to watch: live television – 66%; streaming television
							through a subscription service – 56%; catch-up or on-demand
							television – 38%
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							“Television for me means learning and exploring new knowledge.
							Netflix means the same, but with an added freedom of what I want to
							watch and when”
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							So, the ‘digital revolution’ has facilitated a
							‘television revolution’ with viewers revelling in
							the opportunity to watch more television
							content when and where they want.

							Why has television been so resilient in the face
							of this unprecedented shift in the media
							landscape, where others have floundered?
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							Above all it comes down to the deeply emotional and
							human experience of television. It uniquely has the power
							to move us and in doing so creates powerful bonds.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							86% of us say television prompts sentiment – making us cry, dream or
							think; 71% say that television makes them excited, upset or truly
							elated; 60% claim that television helps them to escape their worries
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							“I became hooked on the show ‘Six Feet Under’. The series finale
							ended...and I was in tears for about 30 minutes after...the way it was
							made, made me think of the concept of death in a whole new way”
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							And it’s not just an emotional relationship that we have
							with television it’s also an intellectual one. Television acts
							as educator, influence and trusted advisor
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							78% say television helps them learn about the world around them and
							70% say television shapes and influences their opinion
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							“(Television provides) unexpected questions, situations, perspectives
							and thoughts that can come about as it makes you think differently
							and expands your horizons”
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							Television made the world a smaller place long before the
							internet and continues to be the pre-eminent place to get our
							trusted information from. The advent of ‘multi-screening’ has
							facilitated the curiosity to learn more ignited by television
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							67% will use a second screen whilst watching the TV set, 47% stating
							that they enjoy the freedom to discover more about what they’re
							watching
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							“When my boyfriend was watching ‘Narcos’, and I thought I might get
							into that show...I Googled about the character that it’s about...and
							found the story really interesting”
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							And it is the strength of the emotional and intellectual
							connection that makes us want to share our television thoughts
							and experiences with others
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							during or after television shows 64% of us talk or message friends and
							family, 52% of us go online to discover more and 42% share, tweet or
							blog online
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							“Talking with friends about a TV Show? OMG - Daily at work!! During
							the programmes texting too!! During the 3 weeks of “I’m a Celeb”
							there was ongoing daily discussion about the behaviour and events of
							the show”
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							Television was the original social network and
							it continues to set the cultural agenda, the
							digital sphere has allowed us to express our
							emotional and intellectual relationship with
							television to an ever wider audience in ever
							increasing amounts.

						<p>[Intro]</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							The emotional bond between television and audiences
							translates into a powerful advertising environment that
							similarly can’t be replicated by other media
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							82% of respondents felt that television advertising evoked an emotion
							print/radio/OOH (x1.7) – which translated to 60% stating that
							television advertising provoked a call to action, compared to just 24%
							compared to 47% for ads on websites (x1.7) and 46% ads in
							for websites.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							“Online advertising is almost always done badly. Popups, video ads, etc
							make me annoyed, and I have built up a big filter. Youtube ads I just
							click away without ever noticing, if a webpage has popup ads I close
							the browser and never visit the site again”
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							One of the fastest growing media is short-form online video with
							the likes of Youtube and Facebook claiming billions of views a
							day. It is also one of the fastest growing advertising media, so we
							asked our respondents a number of questions about how
							viewing an ad in long form television compared to short form.
							The first thing they said is that they don’t notice online video
							advertising
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							63% of respondents claimed to pay attention to advertising
							during/around live television compared to 39% for online video
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							“I just wait for ‘Skip now’. When I’m going to YouTube I want to watch
							something straight away. I know it’s got to be there or it’s not going to
							make them money, but as soon as ‘Skip now’ comes on, that’s it”
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
					  <p>
							Short form video is transient in nature and far less emotionally
							engaging than long form television and this transposes on the
							way advertising is consumed even when it’s the same ad. We
							asked respondents “if you were to see the same ad in two
							different places: once as part of a commercial break during a TV
							show, and once before watching a short video clip online. Would
							you feel differently about the ad, based on the context in which
							you saw it?” and the results were overwhelming:
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							41% felt that the ad would be trustworthy in television compared to 14% in short form,
							and 44% felt that the advertising would be engaging compared to 16% in short form.
							Conversely 38% felt that an ad around short form video is distracting and annoying
							compared to just 17% for television.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							“having to sit through a 30sec advert to watch a short video clip is not
							acceptable, so I close the video”
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							The emotional bond does not exist for short form video, and its
							transient nature makes this an environment where permission
							to enter is more limited. In contrast television sells a unique
							currency, one which delivers a quality of attention and
							identification with plots, characters and real life stories that
							people want to know about or be part of
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							66% of respondents agreed that “television sells unique experiences and cultural currency
							that extends well beyond the live broadcast” with 69% saying television ignited
							conversations and therefore 50% agreeing that television advertising can ignite
							conversations.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							“TV is an integral part of my life, it's where my family gathers and it
							helps start conversations”
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							Television truly encapsulates the human
							experience – this is why television is about
							more than just traffic, views or clicks. The
							emotive allure of television relates to all of us
							in different ways.
