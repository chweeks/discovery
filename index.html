						<h1>TELEVISION:<br> BEYOND TV</h1>
						<p style="font-size: 50%">
							At the outset of the study we decided on a
							definition of ‘television’ and we took our inspiration from an Oxford Dictionaries
							entry that is as relevant today as it was 90 years ago:<br>
							television, noun - a system for converting visual images (with sound)
							into electrical signals, signals, transmitting them by radio or
							other means, and displaying them electronically on a screen.<br>
							In other words television is not an object (unlike the TV set),
							television is a creative medium that can be transmitted and dis-
							played in a variety of forms, as such we informed our respondents
							that they should consider television to be all long form
							broadcast quality video irrespective of how or where consumed.
						</p>

						<h1>BEYOND THE BOX</h1>
						<p>
							If some had predicted that the arrival of digital
							and all its forms of entertainment and
							distractions would overwhelm television, then
							in fact the opposite happened...<br><br>
							Digital has come along and liberated television
							from the box that it was previously held in.
					  </p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							The digital revolution has made television content
							available anytime, anywhere and in doing so pushed it
							firmly into the digital melting pot.
						</p>
						<p>
							71% of television is now consumed on the TV set; almost a third of
							viewing is taking place on laptops, tablets and smartphones.[more data]
						</p>
						<p>
							“I watch some television via online media players on my tablet and
							smartphone, but my main television viewing is on my new large 50
							inch TV”
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>And we can see this trend is even more marked
							 with the younger generation:</p>
						<br>
						<p>53% of 16-34 yr. olds television viewing takes place on a TV set</p>
						<br>
						<p>“I use the screen that is appropriate for the moment”</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							However, it is not the case that the younger generation are
							watching less television:
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							16-34 yr. old television viewers are watching on average 3.9
							hours a day compared to 3.9 hours for 35-44 yr. olds and 4.4
							hours for 55-65 yr. olds
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							When we asked viewers what they thought about the ‘new
							television’ vs. the ‘old television’, mostly they were confused as to
							why we were making a distinction, for them there was no
							difference in content, just more flexibility in consumption
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							regularly claim to watch: live television – 66%; streaming television
							through a subscription service – 56%; catch-up or on-demand
							television – 38%
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							“Television for me means learning and exploring new knowledge.
							Netflix means the same, but with an added freedom of what I want to
							watch and when”
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							So, the ‘digital revolution’ has facilitated a
							‘television revolution’ with viewers revelling in
							the opportunity to watch more television
							content when and where they want.
